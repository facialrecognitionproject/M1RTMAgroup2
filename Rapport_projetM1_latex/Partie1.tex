\section{Context and needs}



\section{Goals or objectives :}
Several methods have been developed in the literature for face recognition. In our work, we chose two extraction techniques characteristics of the face image:
The first method is Eigenface which is based on principal component analysis. The CPA is a mathematical method which can be used to simplify a dataset, reducing its size.
\paragraph{}
The second method is Fisherface which is based on a linear discriminant analysis. LDA is improved PCR method.
\paragraph{}
These two methods should therefore allow us to achieve two prototypes we compare the results. This step is to assess which method provides a more satisfactory result in terms of facial recognition.
