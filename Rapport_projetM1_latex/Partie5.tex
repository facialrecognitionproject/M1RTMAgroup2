\section{Implementation results}
\section{Prospects}
Facial recognition develop tools very useful for people such as our first goals which were to improve parental control and to develop serious in order to help childrens with handicap. But so far, still there are some applications like high security, and ... All those applications require less human efforts, and then the use of this method are factor of unemployement and reduce responsibility from parents.
On this project, we would have expected to have much more time to implement the methods in other way and to optimize much more the programs.

\subsection{Difficulties faced}

When the project began, we set several objectives. To achieve them, we have established a  schedule for work organized. But throughout the project, we have encountered some difficulties: technical difficulties and organizational difficulties.
\paragraph{} 
The main difficulties are :
\begin{itemize}
\item implementation difficulties : because for programming methods, we had to define a unique way to structure the program for consistency in all codes. We have thus established a reference document to have uniform codes.
\item understanding difficulties :everyone had understood in a different way from others  the concept of the methods(eigenfaces and fisherfaces) for the implementation of our algorithm. 
\item Programming difficulties :we have different levels in programming. But that does not prevent us to program
\item Using tools  difficulties : everyone had to program a part of the code, so we needed a way for share and  synchronize our codes. the tool was new and we took time to control this,
\item management difficulties : as we have already said, we set goals and we had established a schedule for work in an organized way, but many secondary, unanticipated and unforeseeable tasks appeared.
\end{itemize}

However we faced all these difficulties, which allowed us to learn more about the two main domain of our project: images processing and programming language .
Finally, these difficulties may be helpful for future work. These can be apprehended in another project


\subsection{Summary}

This project allowed us to gain maturity in the work and help us  to understand the importance of planning, organization, and discipline for the success of a project. In addition, it also gave us the satisfaction of completing the project in a group. Each member benefits from the skills of other members,

We could see that it was a very positive experience for our future because this experience has allowed us to understand the complexity to manage a project, but also the difficulty of understanding and the importance of communication in a group
