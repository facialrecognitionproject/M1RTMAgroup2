At the University of Poitiers, students in Master (professional and research career) of Information and Communication Systems, Emphasis in Network Technologies field have to carry out a project during their first year in order to complete the training. This is the main reason we wrote this report of project.   
\paragraph{}
In fact, several topics were proposed to us and we choose the facial recognition for its multiplicity and variety in term of application fields, such as high security applications, remote monitoring and control of access etc. Indeed, this field is closely linked with human vision reproduction researche and the interaction between a machine and a human, which is a fascinating and booming subject.
\paragraph{}
Facial recognition consist in identifying a person with a picture of his face. It appears to be a quite active field in Vision from computer and Biomety. Recognition with an individual face is a skill of Biometry which is still to improve. Indeed, the acquired (captured) picture represents variation much higher than other characteristics (makeup, presence or absence of glasses, aging and expression of emotion). The method of face recognition is sensitive to the variation of the light and change the position of the face in the image acquisition. But still the system obtained is not yet able to adapt itself to certain kinds of variations on a face.
\paragraph{}
In fact, achieve the two prototypes necessary for our analysis we adopted the following outline anouncing this report. First, we define the project environment and aims at first, then we develop the state of the art methods to be programmed, as it were the theoretical concept. Then we establish a technical report is to explain the use of our prototypes made and finally we leave the analysis of the use of these prototypes to the comparison of our results.
